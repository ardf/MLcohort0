"""
1. Download the data from the link here
2. Write a function in python script to do the following:
i. Inputs: Input the folder name and csv filename through command line
ii. To-Do:
1. Read all the images
2. Read the csv file, and get the image label names and coordinates
3. Draw the bounding boxes for every image, using the
corresponding imageâ€™s coordinates (Use different colour and
thickness for the bounding boxes)
4. Add labels for every image (Use different font, font colour, font
size)
5. Create another folder and save all the images to the folder
6. Push the code to GitHub, and show few samples of the before and after on the Readme.md file.
